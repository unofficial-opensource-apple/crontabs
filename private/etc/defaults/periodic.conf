# This is defaults/periodic.conf - a file full of useful variables that
# you can set to change the default behaviour of periodic jobs on your
# system.  You should not edit this file!  Put any overrides into one of the
# $periodic_conf_files instead and you will be able to update these defaults
# later without spamming your local configuration information.
#
# The $periodic_conf_files files should only contain values which override
# values set in this file.  This eases the upgrade path when defaults
# are changed and new features are added.
#
# For a more detailed explanation of all the periodic.conf variables, please
# refer to the periodic.conf(5) manual page.
